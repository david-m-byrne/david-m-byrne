			<p>I focus on the effect of information technology on economic growth and the organization of economic activity.  If you're working in this area, I'd be interested to hear about it.</p>
			<p>It's easy to point to what IT can do (say, draw a picture of a horse driving a car) and jump to the conclusion it will change the economy.  Finding and measuring that change is far harder. Much of my work has been directed toward improving measurement of the production and use of IT.  Existing data does not support serious analysis of the life cycle of IT innovation, 
			its effect on productivity growth, and the changing structure of the tech sector supply chain.  Targeted improvements to measurement of production, investment, consumption, and depreciation
			have been effective, but insufficient.  I'm focused on building a database covering stocks and flows for all stages of the global electronics industrial sector with cross-country, time-series, and cross-product consistency, ensured by a common approach to measurement.</p>
			<p>I give a twenty minute overview of these issues <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnHoxfmytHo">in this video<a></a></p>
