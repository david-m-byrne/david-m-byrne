			<p>I study information technology (IT) innovation, its effects on economic growth, and the IT supply chain. If you're working in these areas, I'd be interested to hear about it.</p>
			<p>It's easy to jump from what IT can do (say, draw a picture of a horse driving a car) to the conclusion the economy will change in response.  Identifying and measuring that change is far harder. Existing data does not support serious analysis of the life cycle of IT innovation, 
			its effect on productivity growth, and the changing structure of the tech sector supply chain. I give a twenty minute overview of these issues <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnHoxfmytHo">in this video</a></p>
			<p>Building on that foundation, I consider the prospects for AI to transform the economy, the effects of political, public health, and climate shock on the global electronics supply chain, and the history of solid-state electronics innovation and its effect on productivity.</p>

               	<strong>Innovation and Productivity</strong>  
		    <ul>
			    <li><em>GenAI at the Crossroads: Light Bulb, Dynamo, or Microscope?</em> (with Martin Baily, Aidan Kane, and Paul Soto) <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14588">(working version on arXiv)</a> With the advent of generative AI (genAI), the potential scope of artificial intelligence has increased dramatically, but the future effect of genAI on productivity remains uncertain with the effect of the technology on the innovation process a crucial open question.  Some labor-saving innovations, such as the light bulb, temporarily raise productivity growth as adoption spreads, but the effect fades when the market is saturated; that is, the level of output per hour is permanently higher but the growth rate is not.  In contrast, two types of technologies stand out as having longer-lived effects on productivity growth.  First, there are technologies known as general-purpose technologies (GPTs).  GPTs are (1) widely adopted, (2) spur abundant knock-on innovations (new goods and services, process efficiencies, and business reorganization), and (3) improve continuously, refreshing this innovation cycle; the electric dynamo is an example.  Second, there are inventions of methods of invention (IMIs). IMIs increase the efficiency of the research and development process, generating new ideas more quickly and cheaply; the compound microscope is an example. We show that GenAI has the characteristics of both a GPT and an IMI---an encouraging sign.  Even so, for genAI to boost productivity growth, its contribution will have to exceed the fading growth effects of past IT innovations baked into the trend, including predecessor AI</li>

		<strong>Industrial Organization and Geography</strong> 
		    <ul>
			<li><em>Risk in the Electronics Supply Chain from Soup to Nuts</em>  Abstract: Fueled by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and rising tension between mainland China and Taiwan, policymakers have moved supply chain risk to the front burner with a particular focus on the electronics sector.  To support rigorous discussion of the this issue, we provide annual indicators from 2000 forward for  risk of political instability, natural disaster, industrial accident, and transportation in the electronics sector.  Broadly, risk increased through roughly 2010 as China rapidly increased its share of global electronics production. Since 2010, risk has either held steady or declined, depending on type.   Risk profiles vary substantially across the industries that make up the sector---mineral processing, chip manufacturing, equipment assembly, etc.---and across types of equipment.  Locations producing low- to moderate-value products in high volume are characterized by higher supply chain risk.  In addition to these supply shocks, demand shocks can play an important role in supply chain disruptions, as illustrated by the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>
			<li><em>Nodes and Edges in the Electronics Sector</em> (With Nicole Hoffman)  Abstract:  We document the pattern of activity (production, bilateral trade, and sales) by country for electronic components and final electronics (computers, communication equipment, and special-purpose electronics) for the 1992-2024 period.  We provide quantitative indicators of the complexity of the network and the elasticity of the system with respect to trade policy changes.</li>

		<strong>Economic Measurement</strong>
                	<ul>
			<li><em>The Digital Economy: Three Fundamental Measurement Challenges</em> <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnHoxfmytHo">Presentation</a>  Abstract: Previous critical reviews of price statistics have focused on the shortcomings of individual price indexes, including incomplete accounting for substitution among items, confounding of inflation and quality change, among others. \emph{Systemic problems} in the inflation measurement system have been largely ignored, including inconsistency in price measures across products, over time, and among countries. We illustrate these problems using examples from information technology (IT), focusing on macroeconomic analysis.  We then identify and discuss three barriers  to the correction of these problems in the statistical system: Balkanization, perfectionism, and recency bias.</li> 
			<li><em>Transistors all the way Down:  Viability of Direct Volume Measurement (and Price Indexes) for Semiconductors</em> (with Adrian Hamins-Puertolas and Molly Harnish)  Abstract: he semiconductor (solid-state electronics) industry is a prime example of global production sharing, of the translation of basic research into productivity, and of the power of a general-purpose technology to boost economic growth.  Study of these questions requires measures of industry output and prices that are complete and consistent across time, economies, and products.  Such data are not currently available.  We solve this problem by measuring volume directly using plant-level capacity, industry utilization, and parameters for the state of technology.  Our output and implicit price indexes for microprocessors, memory chips, and other logic for the 1996-2023 period compare favorably to existing indexes deemed to be reliable.  However, in some periods, our output and price measures suggest rather different stylized facts for the global industry, including a smaller surge in chip production in the late 1990s and rapid price declines for GPUs in recent years.  <a href="https://david-m-byrne.github.io/david-m-byrne/byrne-hamins-puertolas-harnish_aea-2024.pdf">Slides</a> for presentation at 2024 ASSA meetings.</li>
